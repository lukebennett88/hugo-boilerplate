This is a style sample for a hugo boilerplate website made by [Luke Bennett](https://lukebennett.me). The purpose of this post is to make it easier to style the website by showing all of the common HTML elements in one place.

This paragraph is for checking line length and showing how text wraps. It has to be very long so that it will wrap even on wide screen devices. Is the text very legible? Should it be larger or smaller? Maybe a different typeface? What about line height of paragraphs, a little too much is better than not enough. Check the margin and padding while you're at it.

- This is an unordered list
- There are three bullet points here
- Do they look OK?

What about **bold** text? Maybe some _italics_. Don't forget some nice “curly quotes” (not all fonts have these, so it's something to consider.)

## Level 2 heading

Here's a bit more text to see what it looks like under a h2.

Does the margin on the top and bottom of the heading look good to you?

### Level 3 heading

1. What about an _ordered_ list?
2. Three items should be enough for testing right?
3. Yes I think three is probably enough

You're not going to use this on every website, about about styling `code text`? This should be in a monospace font.

You might also want to do syntax highlighting, so here is a block of javascript for you to layout.

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require("./lang/" + l);
  return true;
};
```

Next up, blockquotes.

> This is what a blockquote looks like.

> I'll add a second paragraph here that is long enough to cause line wrapping. Once again, check for padding and margin, font size etc.

Here’s a full-width image:

Further paragraphs of text. And yet more text. A bit more text too, for good measure.

Here’s a screenshot-type image, with a caption:

Further paragraphs of text. And yet more text, followed by a horizontal rule.
